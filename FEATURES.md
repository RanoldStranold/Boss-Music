# Boss Music Mod Features

## Core Music System
- **Dynamic Music Fading:** When boss music begins, the vanilla game music will automatically fade out and the boss track will fade in. Upon completion, the boss music will fade out, allowing vanilla music to resume naturally.
- **Seamless Looping:** The boss music track will loop continuously throughout the encounter.
- **Concurrency Management:** The system will ensure that only one boss music track plays at a time. If a boss track is already active, it will not be interrupted or overlapped by new boss encounters.

## Boss-Specific Triggers
### Ender Dragon
- **Start Conditions:** The music will start when the player enters The End, provided the Ender Dragon is alive. This includes both the initial fight and any subsequent respawns.
- **Stop Conditions:** The music will fade out when the Ender Dragon is defeated, if the player moves too far away from the boss, or when the player leaves The End dimension.

## Configuration


## Implemented Changes Log

**I. Project Setup & Feature Definition:**
*   Created `FEATURES.md` to outline the mod's desired functionalities.

**II. Core Mod Functionality & Bug Fixing:**

*   **Mixin Crash Resolution:**
    *   Moved the `IMusicTracker` interface to a new `net.ranold.accessor` package to resolve a Fabric Mixin `IllegalClassLoadError`.
    *   Updated all references to `IMusicTracker` in `BossMusicManager.java` and `MusicTrackerMixin.java`.
    *   Removed the now-empty original `IMusicTracker.java` file from the `mixin` package.
*   **Music Looping:**
    *   Configured boss music to loop continuously by setting the `repeat` parameter to `true` in `FadingSoundInstance.java`.
*   **Sound Category Management:**
    *   Initially set boss music to `SoundCategory.MUSIC`.
    *   Attempted to use `SoundCategory.RECORDS` and `SoundCategory.HOSTILE` for separate volume control, but reverted to `SoundCategory.MUSIC` as it's essential for the music to correctly replace vanilla background music.
*   **Dynamic Music Fading:**
    *   Implemented `FadingSoundInstance.java`: A custom `TickableSoundInstance` that handles smooth fade-in and fade-out effects for boss music.
    *   Modified `BossMusicManager.java` to utilize `FadingSoundInstance` for playing and stopping music, triggering fade-in on start and fade-out on stop.
    *   Removed the redundant `BossMusicInstance.java` class.
*   **Robust Boss Detection & Triggering (`BossMusicTicker.java`):**
    *   Refactored the `BossMusicTicker` to be stateless, relying on `BossMusicManager` for active music state.
    *   Corrected `Box` creation from `Vec3d` to `BlockPos` and fixed `World.THE_END` reference to `World.END`.
    *   Implemented **Hysteresis** using `START_BOSS_RANGE` (150 blocks) and `STOP_BOSS_RANGE` (170 blocks) to prevent music flickering at range edges and improve relog behavior.
    *   Ensured Wither music starts immediately upon spawn (removed `getInvulnerableTimer()` check).
    *   Ensured Ender Dragon music only plays when the player is in The End dimension.
*   **Vanilla Music Management:**
    *   Re-added the explicit `client.getMusicTracker().stop()` call in `BossMusicManager.startBossMusic` to ensure vanilla music stops when boss music begins (acknowledging the abrupt stop as a current technical limitation).
    *   Implemented logic in `BossMusicManager.tick()` to play `MusicSound.END` if the player is in The End dimension when boss music concludes, otherwise, it attempts to resume the last vanilla music.
*   **General Code Cleanup:**
    *   Removed redundant server-side event handlers (`ServerLivingEntityEvents.AFTER_DEATH`) as client-side logic is now robust.
    *   Corrected missing imports in `rbmClient.java`.
*   **Logging:**
    *   Added detailed logging to `BossMusicManager.java` and `BossMusicTicker.java` to provide visibility into the mod's behavior during gameplay.

**III. Volume Slider (Attempted & Workaround):**

*   **Attempted Dedicated Slider:** Made a significant effort to implement a dedicated "Boss Music" volume slider by creating custom `SoundCategory` mixins and UI injection mixins (`SoundCategoryMixin`, `SoundOptionsScreenMixin`, `SoundOptionsScreenAccessor`).
*   **Result:** This attempt was unsuccessful due to persistent compilation issues related to Minecraft's obfuscated names, which could not be reliably resolved within the current environment.
*   **Workaround:** All code related to the failed dedicated slider was removed. The boss music is now routed through the `SoundCategory.MUSIC` (main music slider) as it's the only way to ensure it correctly replaces vanilla music.

**IV. Outstanding Issues (Needs Fixing):**
*   **Location:** `BossMusicManager.java`
*   **Error:** `cannot find symbol variable END location: class MusicSound`
*   **Description:** The code is attempting to reference `MusicSound.END` to play "The End" music after the Ender Dragon is defeated. However, `END` is not a valid static field on the `MusicSound` class for this purpose.
