## Update 2.0 is here!

This update overhauls the entire system as well as adding some new features!

# <big>True Boss Music</big>

Lets face it, vanilla boss fights are boring.
Sure, you could install a mod to make the fight harder, giving the boss some new attacks, maybe more health, but it still lacks something that, in my opinion, all boss fights should have.

<big> _Music_</big>

This mod fixes that, with some bonus features as well.







## Boss list
*   Ender Dragon - [Broken Heart of Ender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ57Q5Y1_os)*
*   Wither - [The Four Horsemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsOWi_3RFu4)*
* More bosses will be added soon, check out the [Roadmap](https://github.com/RanoldStranold/Boss-Music/wiki/Planned-Features) for more info
  

## Features
* Boss Music will dynamicly fade in and out depending on how far you are from the boss.
* Vanilla music will stop playing during boss music.
* Consistant music playing when logging in and out of the game.
* Multiplayer support.
